# OpenSRS
A customizable, user friendly web SRS based on FSRS v4.5 and developed for a school project.
      
## Notes
- This project has been made for a school project, and is fully in French, my native tongue. I plan to translate it in the near future, but if you want to use a reliable flashcards app/SRS, just use Anki instead of my website.
- This project isn't finished yet, the website is still private.

## Main features
- **Simple user interface**, nothing to configure
- **Web based SRS**: just open your favorite browser and you're ready to use OpenSRS !
- **Learn virtually anything you want**, remember forever: OpenSRS is using [the most efficient spaced repetition scheduler currently available](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark), FSRS v4.5.
  (To implement:) It can predict accurately when you will forget a card, and will automatically be optimized according to your past reviews (manual values can be entered as well).
- **Using jpdb ?** You can import cards from jpdb, your review history, and continue your learning course from here !
